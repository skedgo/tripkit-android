SkedGo Android Shared Library!
=============================

Welcome!

This repository holds common code which can be shared between the suite of SkedGo Android applications.

See each folder for more information on what each project does.

The SkedGo keystore is also stored here. This is a *very* important file, used to sign all production releases of SkedGo files

NOTE: As of 26/04/2013, the branch 'NewShared' will hold the latest code. This is a fresh start from previous common libraries, as the old stuff wasn't needed anymore!
